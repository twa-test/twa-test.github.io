Carole Kim is a media artist with a focus on video projection for multi-media installation, performance and photography. She has presented her work in diverse contexts including experimental art, music, dance, theater and site-specific installation. As someone who works extensively with technology, it is where technology meets up with the human, physical, tangible world that interests her most. She is fascinated by the merging of physical space, the body and the illusionistic world of the moving image. Through this juxtaposition she plays with relative scale, dimensionality and how matter can appear to commingle.

At the onset of the pandemic, Carole Kim compressed her installations to fit beneath her kitchen table. This intimate “venue” has proven to be an ideal site for live connection from remote locations for collaborative performance. Live performances within these micro-projection installations  have been presented by NowNet Arts Lab, Montalvo Art Center, echoreaume-Vienna, Optosonic [e] Lab, Earth Day Art Model Festival, SEAMUS Festival, CURRENTS New Media Festival, New Music Gathering Festival, Australasian Computer Music Conference 2021.
