Luisa Muhr is a multi-lingual, multi-and-interdisciplinary performer, improvisor, director, installation artist, sound artist, and experimental theater maker, originally from Vienna (Austria), lives and works in New York, and is at home in the experimental/avant-garde. Luisa is of Balkan descent (Hungarian and Constantinople-Greek) and the proud great-granddaughter of a Socialist Holocaust-survivor.

As a performer she specializes in performance, vocal, movement, installation, sound, and theater arts. Luisa is also the creator and curator of New York’s leading interdisciplinary womxn/non-binary artists series Women Between Arts at The New School (College of Performing Arts) and the co-founder/artistic director of FENGARI Works.

Her primary focus is the art and exploration of voice, sound, and movement in space, often working with musicians in an experimental, theatrical, ritualesque setting, exploring the relationship between sonic and physical movement (what she refers to as “field work”).

Luisa was an Artist in Residence at Pioneer Works (April 2019), the Pocantico Center of the Rockefeller Estate with Arturo O’Farrill (June 2019), and has been a commissioned artist by Roulette Intermedium (2021) and the Austrian Cultural Forum NY (2018, 2020).
