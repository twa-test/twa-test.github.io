Dr. Miller Puckette is known for authoring Max, a graphical development environment for music and multimedia synthesis, which he developed while working at IRCAM in the late 1980s. He is also the author of Pure Data (Pd), a real-time performing platform for audio, video and graphical programming language for the creation of interactive computer music and multimedia works, written in the 1990s with input from many others in the computer music and free software communities.

As an MIT undergraduate he won the 1979 Putnam mathematics competition. He was a researcher at the MIT Media Lab from its inception until 1986, then at IRCAM, and is now professor of music at the University of California, San Diego. He has been a visiting professor at Columbia University  and the Technical University of Berlin, and has received two honorary degrees and the SEAMUS award.
